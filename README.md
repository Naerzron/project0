# project0
In this project I have done six html files, one css file and another css file using scss.

In index we have the main page. This is my very fisrt programming, but with boostrap 4, tool that we had to use in the project, I did the navbar and then I personaliced it. In all html files we have a backgroun image, i tried to make all pages mobile responsive in the way I could. I found the fact of use different forms at the same time to make the project a little difficult if I wanted to finish the page like I wanted. Nevermind, Im sure I will improve my skills with this lectures, thank you.

Using the navbar we can go to the another html files.

guides.html its an example of list.

all_list.html its an example of grid with boostrap, where I used boostrap cards too. The three first "See More" takes us to another html files, where we can see examples of tables, another css selectors and the re3.html its done entirely with scss. 

As you can see I got inspired in a videogame reviews page, like can be "Metacritic" or another examples.
